# cse163-final-project
To run this project:
1. Clone repository to local computer
2. Open folder in VScode.
3. Install plotly and plotly.express
4. Run load_data.py, analysis.py, and then test_file.py in that order.
5. All plots should display in browser or pop up. If this does not work, you can run the test_file.py in an interactive window to see all plots.
6. If Test Set Performance plot does not show points, comment out a.threats_over_time, a.price_stressors, and a.pop_by_state in the main function of test_file.py. This should allow the results of the Test Set Performance plot to display, along with the Validation Set Performance Plot.
